In this small project,I was able to find the boundaries or so called 'Contours' of a group of 6 coins placed together using the OpenCV library.The image is intentionally blurred to remove some unnecessary noise .

The following was the output of the code where the contours(boundaries of the coins) were detected:

By observing the output ,One limitation observed is that the 6 coins are considered as a big structure as inner boundaries of the coin are not detected.
